## Development

Here's what you need to set up a local development environment.

### Tools

- [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi) 2.4.53
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) 8.1.6
  - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) 2.3.7
- [Volta](https://volta.sh/) 1.0.4 (optional)
  - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 14.17.0
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 7.16.0

### Setup

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:OblikStudio/kirby-link-field.git`
1. Install npm dependencies with `npm i`
1. Install Composer dependencies with `composer install`

### Workflow

#### Test Site

This repo also doubles as a test website for the plugin. Once you run `composer install`, you'll download Kirby. After you've started Apache, you'll be able to open the project in the browser and see a simple webpage. Then, you can navigate to `http://localhost/panel` and test how the link field behaves in the admin interface.

This is done with the help of `index.site.php`. All files related to the test site are excluded from the final package in `.gitattributes`.

#### Testing

You can run PHPUnit with `composer test` to see if there are any failing tests. This is done automatically in the aforementioned pre-commit hook.
